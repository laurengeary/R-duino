# Introduction


# Results

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
dat.f <- list.files(pattern = "couch|active.csv") #find the files

dat.l <- list() #make an empty list

for(i in dat.f){
  met.dat<- unlist(strsplit(i,"_")) #split of the filename string
  who <- met.dat[1] #store the first element
  activity <- gsub(".csv","",met.dat[2]) #store second element, dropping CSV with gsub()
  dat.l[[i]]<- read_csv(i)%>%
    mutate(who=who,activity=activity) #read, then store data with additional columns of metada in list as position unique to i
  
}
dat <- do.call(rbind,dat.l) #combine the list into table

dat%>%
  ggplot()+geom_boxplot(aes(x=activity,y=degC))+facet_grid(.~who) #plot to see what we get

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
